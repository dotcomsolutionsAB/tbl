    Orders started coming in due to the result of extensive marketing by Taher M Faizullabhoy, the chief coordinator of the business which led to building up a huge customer base. TBL joined hands with Timken Bearings in 2003 and executed its largest order in 2004. With customers showing confidence in Jainex Industrial and with the encouragement of our principals and directors a company was launched in partnership between our local partner Mr Ameir Fakhri and the rest of the directors of Jainex Industrial in April 2004. This boosted the confidence of our customers all the more and they depended on us for more products.
